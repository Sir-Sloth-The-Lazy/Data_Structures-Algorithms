# 🚀 DSA Revision Vault

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Vault** — a carefully organized and continually evolving repository where I revise, solve, and document key concepts, patterns, and problems in DSA. This is my go-to resource to prepare for coding interviews, contests, and system design rounds.

> 📘 *"Consistency is more important than intensity."* — This repo reflects that motto in action.

## 🧭 Navigation

Each folder is self-contained with problem statements, explanations (where needed), and different approaches if applicable (brute force vs optimized). Example:

```

📁 Basic Arrays
┣ 📄 reverse_array.cpp
┣ 📄 find_max_min.py
┗ 📄 kadane_algo.cpp

📁 Basic Recursion
┣ 📄 factorial.cpp
┣ 📄 fibonacci.cpp
┗ 📄 subsequence_generator.py

```
